"qRT-PCR showed that circGFRA1 was overexpressed in ovarian cancer tissues. Inhibition of circGFRA1 suppressed cell proliferation and invasion, but induced cell apoptosis in ovarian cancer.",31417634
"PVT1 was the most amplifed gene in ovarian cancer patients, and it was highly correlated with poor survival outcomes.",31222482
"PILRLS, which as an oncogene significantly overexpressed in retroperitoneal liposarcoma.",28129655
"Functionally, loss of circSMC3 abolished the proliferation and motility of gastric cancer cells. Mechanically, circSMC3 decreased miR-4720-3p expression by acting as a miRNA sponge",32314520
"knockdown of miR-133a exhibited the opposite effect, which revealed that miR-133a negatively regulates glioma progression.",32104215
The results show that MUC1-C activates a posttranscriptional mechanism involving miR-135b-mediated downregulation of AR mRNA levels.,22473899
"Co-treatment with decitabine and doxorubicin results first in increased OCT4 and mir-145, then a decrease in both, suggesting that OCT4 and mir-145 regulate each other.",22486352
LARP7 negatively regulates positive transcription elongation factor-b (p-TEFb) by binding to and stabilizing 7sk RNA.,22488152
"It was especially valuable for superficial G(2)-G(3) patients (sensitivity: 86.4%, 92.3%) at a high risk for muscular invasion.",22490897
"On a more mechanistic level,recent studies have revealed the contribution of lncRNAs as proto-oncogenes,e.g.",22492512
"Based on these findings, we strongly recommend that PWSencoded SNORD115 and SNORD116 be considered as bo fide box C/D snoRs.",22495932
"Combination of 4-HPR (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide) and EGCG ((-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate) most significantly decreased expression of OGmiRs (miR-92, miR-93, and miR-106b) and increased expression of TSmiRs (miR-7-1, miR-34a, and miR-99a) in both cell lines(SK-N-BE2 and IMR-32 cells)",22498172
MicroRNA-214 Regulates the Acquired Resistance to Gefitinib via the PTEN/AKT Pathway in EGFR-mutant Cell Lines.,22502680
"miR-181b and miR-210 discriminatedPCa from normal individuals with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.745 and 0.772, respectively.",22504911
"Both in vivo and in vitro, myelin antigen stimulation resulted in significant up-regulation of miR-301a, miR-21, and miR-155.",22517757
Transfection assay revealed that both Ago1 and Ago2 synergistically induced miR-21 and miR-21* when the mir-21 plasmid was co-transfected with either.,22529925
