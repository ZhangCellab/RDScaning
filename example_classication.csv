The PVT1 expressions were significantly enhanced in tissues of pituitary adenoma and cancer cells.,1
"We found that LINC01617 was overexpressed in esophageal cancer, and its expression was associated with poor prognosis of esophageal cancer. knockout of LINC01617 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of esophageal cancer cells.",1
"overexpression of LINC00961 significantly suppressed glioma cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, we found that overexpression of LINC00961 inhibited glioma cell EMT.",1
"We found that LINC00641 expression was significantly down-regulated in bladder cancer tissues. Down-regulation of LINC00641 in patients with bladder cancer predicts poor prognosis. Gain-of-function assays indicated that LINC00641 up-regulation markedly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells. LINC00641 was demonstrated to interact with miR-197-3p.",1
"Moreover, increased expression of hsa_circ_0137439 was correlated with higher tumor stage, higher tumor grade, higher lymph node status, and history of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).",1
"Accumulating evidences show that SPRY4-IT1 was dysregulated in various cancers, including melanoma, breast cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and amplification of SPRY4-IT1 was associated with different clinicopathological features of cancer patients.",1
"Additionally, the data indicated that the increased expression of SUMO1P3 is significantly associated with tumor progression and the poor survival of patients with pancreatic cancer.",1
Higher ACVR2B-AS1 expression is an independent adverse prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in liver cancer patients.,1
"AC114812.8 was significantly upregulated in BC and could markedly facilitate the proliferation, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.",1
These results imply that A2M-AS1 might be a promising candidate prognostic factor and therapeutic target for breast cancer.,1
A novel long noncoding RNA-LOWEG is low expressed in gastric cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell invasion.,1
A novel long non-coding RNA lnc-GNAT1-1 is low expressed in colorectal cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor through regulating RKIP-NF-kB-Snail circuit.,1
A negative feedback loop between long noncoding RNA NBAT1 and Sox9 inhibits the malignant progression of gastric cancer cells.,1
"Further study suggested that lncRNA-PE downregulated miR-200a/b by repressing the primary transcript expression, enhanced ZEB1 expression, and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",1
"17A is expressed in human brain,and we report that it is upregulated in cerebral tissues derived from Alzheimer disease patients.",1
"The relative level of p53 mRNA expression was examined by Northern analysis,with one tumor showing negligible expression of p53 mRNA.",0
the mRNA product of IPW may play a role in the imprinting process.,0
Override radiation-induced cell cycle G2/M arrest|override radiation-induced cell growth inhibition.,0
"The serum levels of miR-130a, miR-27b and miR-210 may serve as potential biomarkers for early stage ASO.",0
"In vivo genome-wide analyses indicate that promoter regions of a significant fraction of dysregulated miRNA transcripts, including a large polycistronic cluster of brain-specific miRNAs, are DNA-methylated and are bound directly by Mecp2.",0
Functional analysis demonstrates that the 3' UTR of messenger RNA encoding Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) can be targeted by multiple miRNAs aberrantly up-regulated in the absence of Mecp2.,0
"One particular deletion occurring 283 kb away from FOXL2 disrupts a lncRNA,PISRT1,that was shown by chromatin confirmation capture to physically loop with FOXL2.",0
The opposing actions of Lin-28 and let-7 miRNAs on Müller glia differentiation and dedifferentiation are similar to that of embryonic stem cells and suggest novel targets for stimulating Müller glia dedifferentiation and retinal regeneration in mammals.,0
Schmidt then demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of MALAT1 significantly impaired migration and invasion in vitro.,0
